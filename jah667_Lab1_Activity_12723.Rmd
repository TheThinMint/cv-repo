## Reviews from Satisfied Customers

*"She saved me from poison-laced wine! I owe her a blood debt"* -Alorran, King of Amadicia

*"Madame Hughes is always eager to undergo standard testing for taste-bud density and always volunteers for extra trainings, sometimes even during her lunch hour. Even at rest, one can never be too careful."* -Madame Dumont, royal taste tester to Marie Antoinette

*"Twice I have made the Euphrates itself run red with blood, so you could say I'm not short on enemies. Ms. Hughes works by the light of the full moon to ensure the highest quality in her sensory evaluation work. For her, keeping me alive and tyrannical is more than just a job; it's a passion."* -Nandor the Relentless
